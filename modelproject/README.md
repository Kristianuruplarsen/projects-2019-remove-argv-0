# Modelproject

In this project we solve the OLG model using sympy. We first show a few figures from the model when solved using log utility. We then show that the model cannot be solved analytically when using square root utility and use the convergence rule in the model to show a numerical estimate of the optimal per capita capital level with square root utility.
